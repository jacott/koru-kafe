# Kafe (Koru Accelerated Front End)

Kafe is a front end server written in Rust, designed specifically to work with the **Koru** Node.js
framework. It is intended to replace Nginx in the Koru stack, providing a high-performance entry
point for application traffic.

## Project Goal
While Kafe currently functions as a specialized replacement for Nginx, the long-term goal of the
project is to accelerate Koru applications by moving and duplicating performance-critical
functionality from the Node.js layer into the Rust environment.
